> ## Getting the Data
> 
> The data we will be using is taken from the [gapminder][gapminder] dataset.
> To obtain it, download and unzip the file 
> [python-novice-gapminder-data.zip]({{page.root}}/files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip).
> In order to follow the presented material, you should launch a Jupyter 
> notebook in the root directory.

> ## Review From Yesterday
> 
> Write a function that determines whether a year between 1901 and 2000 is a leap year, 
> where it prints a message like "1904 is a leap year" or "1905 is not a leap year" as 
> output.  Use this function to evaluate the years 1928, 1950, 1959, 1972 and 1990.    
> 
> Hint: the percent symbol '%' is the modular operator in Python.  So: 
>
> ~~~
> print('8 mod 4 equals', 8 % 4)
> print('10 mod 4 equals', 10 % 4)
> ~~~
> {: .python}
> ~~~
> 8 mod 4 equals 0
> 10 mod 4 equals 2
> ~~~
> {: .output}
> 
> If you're not sure where to start, see the partial answers below: 
> 
> > ## Suggested Approach
> > 
> > First, try to determine how to use the mod operator `%` to determine 
> > if a year is divisible by 4 (and thus a leap year or not).  
> > 
> > Then, create a conditional statement to use this information, and put 
> > it into a function.  
> > 
> > Finally, create a list of the years given in the exercise.  Use a for loop 
> > and your function to evaluate these years.  
> > 
> {: .solution}
> 
> > ## Modular Arthimetic
> > 
> > If a year in the range specified is divisible by four, it is a leap year.  
> > If a number is divisible by 4, then the arithmetic expression "number mod four" (or 
> > `num % 4` in Python) will equal zero.  
> > 
> {: .solution}
> 
> > ## Conditional Statement
> > 
> > Fill in the blanks: 
> > 
> > ~~~
> > year = 1904
> > if year % 4 == _____:
> >     print(year, _______________)
> > ______: 
> >     print(year, "is not a leap year.")
> > ~~~
> > {: .python}

> {: .solution}

> > ## Function

> > Fill in the blanks:

> > ~~~
> > def leap_year(year):

> > {: .python}

> {: .solution}

> > ## Loop

> > Fill in the blanks:

> > ~~~
> > year_list = [1928, 1950, 1959, 1972, 1990]
> > for year in ______:
> >     ________(year)
> > ~~~

> {: .solution}

> > ## Complete Solution
> > 
> > ~~~
> > def leap_year(year):
> >     if year % 4 == 0:
> >         print(year, "is a leap year")
> >     else:
> >         print(year, "is not a leap year.")
> > 
> > year_list = [1928, 1950, 1959, 1972, 1990]
> > for year in year_list:
> >     leap_year(year)
> > ~~~
> > {: .python}
> > 
> {: .solution}
> 
> If you have time: 
> 
> 1. Expand your function so that it correctly categorizes 
> any year from 0 onwards
> 
> 1. Instead of printing whether a year is a leap year or not, save 
> the results to a python dictionary, where there are two keys ("leap"
> and "not-leap") and the values are a list of years.

## Handling Program Flags

Now we have a program which is capable of handling any number of data sets at once.

But what if we have 50 GDP data sets? It would be awfully tedious to type in the names
of 50 files in the command line, so let's add a flag to our program indicating that we
would like it to generate a plot for each data set in the current directory.

Flags are a convention used in programming to indicate to a program that a non-default behavior
is being requested by the user. In this case, we'll be using a "-a" flag to indicate to our program
we would like it to operate on all data sets in our directory.

To explore what files are in the current directory, we'll be using the Python's `glob` module.

- In Unix, the term "globbing" means "matching a set of files with a pattern".
- The most common patterns are:
  - `*` meaning "match zero or more characters"
  - `?` meaning "match exactly one character"
- Python contains the `glob` library to provide pattern matching functionality
- The `glob` library contains a function also called `glob` to match file patterns
- E.g., `glob.glob('*.txt')` matches all files in the current directory
  whose names end with `.txt`.
- Result is a (possibly empty) list of character strings.

<pre>
import sys
<b>import glob</b>
import pandas
# we need to import part of matplotlib
# because we are no longer in a notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

<b># check for -a flag in arguments
if "-a" in sys.argv:
    filenames = glob.glob("data/*gdp*.csv")
else:
    filenames = sys.argv[1:]

for filename in filenames:</b>

    # load data and transpose so that country names are
    # the columns and their gdp data becomes the rows
    data = pandas.read_csv(filename, index_col = 'country').T

    # create a plot of the transposed data
    ax = data.plot(title = filename)

    # set some plot attributes
    ax.set_xlabel("Year")
    ax.set_ylabel("GDP Per Capita")
    # set the x locations and labels
    ax.set_xticks(range(len(data.index)))
    ax.set_xticklabels(data.index, rotation = 45)

    # save the plot with a unique file name
    split_name1 = filename.split('.')[0] #data/gapminder_gdp_XXX
    split_name2 = filename.split('/')[1]
    save_name = 'figs/'+split_name2 + '.png'
    plt.savefig(save_name)
</pre>

### Updating the repository

Yet another successful update to the code. Let's
commit our changes.

```bash
$ git add gdp_plots.py
$ git commit -m "Adding a flag to run script for all gdp data sets."
```

## The Right Way to Do It

If our programs can take complex parameters or multiple filenames,
we shouldn't handle `sys.argv` directly.
Instead,
we should use Python's `argparse` library,
which handles common cases in a systematic way,
and also makes it easy for us to provide sensible error messages for our users.
We will not cover this module in this lesson
but you can go to Tshepang Lekhonkhobe's [Argparse tutorial](https://docs.python.org/dev/howto/argparse.html)
that is part of Python's Official Documentation.

## Review From Yesterday

In your notebook, write a function that determines whether a year between 1901 and 2000 is a leap year,
where it prints a message like "1904 is a leap year" or "1905 is not a leap year" as
output.  Use this function to evaluate the years 1928, 1950, 1959, 1972 and 1990.
Essentially, given this list of years:

```python
years = [1928, 1950, 1959, 1972, 1990]
```

Produce something like:

```
1928 is a leap year
1950 is not a leap year.
1959 is not a leap year.
1972 is a leap year
1990 is not a leap year.
```

{: .output

Hint: the percent symbol '%' is the modular operator in Python.  So:

```python
print('8 mod 4 equals', 8 % 4)
print('10 mod 4 equals', 10 % 4)
```

```output
8 mod 4 equals 0
10 mod 4 equals 2
```

If you're not sure where to start, see the partial answers below:

> ## Suggested Approach
> 
> First, try to determine how to use the mod operator `%` to determine
> if a year is divisible by 4 (and thus a leap year or not).
> 
> Then, create a conditional statement to use this information, and put
> it into a function.
> 
> Finally, create a list of the years given in the exercise.  Use a for loop
> and your function to evaluate these years.

> ## Modular Arthimetic
> 
> If a year in the range specified is divisible by four, it is a leap year.
> If a number is divisible by 4, then the arithmetic expression "number mod four" (or
> `num % 4` in Python) will equal zero.

> ## Conditional Statement
> 
> Fill in the blanks:
> 
> ```python
> year = 1904
> if year % 4 == _____:
>     print(year, _______________)
> ______:
>     print(year, "is not a leap year.")
> ```

> ## Function
> 
> Fill in the blanks:
> 
> ```python
> def leap_year(year):
>     _________
> ```

> ## Loop
> 
> Fill in the blanks:
> 
> ```python
> year_list = [1928, 1950, 1959, 1972, 1990]
> for year in ______:
>     ________(year)
> ```

> ## Complete Solution
> 
> ```python
> def leap_year(year):
>     if year % 4 == 0:
>         print(year, "is a leap year")
>     else:
>         print(year, "is not a leap year.")
> 
> year_list = [1928, 1950, 1959, 1972, 1990]
> for year in year_list:
>     leap_year(year)
> ```

If you have time:

1. Expand your function so that it correctly categorizes
  any year from 0 onwards

2. Instead of printing whether a year is a leap year or not, save
  the results to a python dictionary, where there are two keys ("leap"
  and "not-leap") and the values are a list of years.

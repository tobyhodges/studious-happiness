This lesson build on the [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) lesson developed by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/).
It also requires knowledge of the [Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [version control with Git](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/).
This lesosn works with both Jupyter Notebooks and writing scripts with a
text editor to be run in the shell.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

This lesson build on the [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) lesson developed by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/).
It also requires knowledge of the [Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [version control with Git](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/).
This lesosn works with both Jupyter Notebooks and writing scripts with a
text editor to be run in the shell.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.


> ## Prerequisites
>

Learners are expected to have been introduced to the material from the [Unix Shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), the [Plotting and Programming in Python lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/), and the [Version control with Git lesson](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/).
>
> 2. Learners must install Python before the workshop starts.
>
> 3. Learners must get the gapminder data before class starts:
>    please download and unzip the file
